# 🧮 Simple CLI Calculator 

A command-line calculator built using Python.

This project performs basic arithmetic operations with proper input validation and error handling.  
It represents an improved version of my earlier calculator implementation, focusing on cleaner structure and defensive programming.

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ Addition
- ➖ Subtraction
- ✖ Multiplication
- ➗ Division (with zero-division handling)
- 🔼 Power (**)
- √ Square Root (with negative number handling)
- 🔢 Supports decimal numbers (float input)
- 🔁 Continuous calculation mode
- 🛡 Error handling using try/except

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced and improved:

- Writing reusable functions
- Returning values instead of printing inside functions
- Exception handling (`ValueError`)
- Defensive programming (handling edge cases)
- Using loops for continuous execution
- Cleaner program structure using `main()`
- Basic software design principles

## 💡 Future Improvements

 - Add more scientific functions (log, sin, cos, tan)
 - Convert into GUI version using Tkinter
 - Add calculation history
 - Refactor using operator dictionary mapping
 - Write unit tests

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- math module
