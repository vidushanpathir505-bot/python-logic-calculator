# 🧮 Simple CLI Calculator (Refactored Version)

A command-line calculator built using Python.

This version improves upon earlier implementations by using operator dictionary mapping, modular function design, and defensive programming techniques.

This project demonstrates my understanding of clean code structure and iterative improvement.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:

- Writing reusable functions
- Returning values instead of printing inside functions
- Refactoring repetitive code into helper functions
- Using dictionary mapping to simplify conditional logic
- Handling edge cases (division by zero, negative sqrt)
- Defensive programming
- Clean program structure using `main()`
